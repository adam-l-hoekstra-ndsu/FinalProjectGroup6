    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        At Furever Friends, we connect animal shelters with those who wish to adopt lifelong friends. 
        We provide a place to search for dogs and shelters, apply for adoption, track applications, and contact shelter representatives all in one location.
    </p>
    <p>
        We make sure that each adopter is a good match for their new dog, and as such, we have some requirements about who is able to adopt the dogs on our website. 
        Read more below to learn about these requirements and other frequently asked questions.
